# If you want to be able to use GMail to send yourself job listings daily, change the name of this file to credentials.py and enter your Gmail/ Google App password information below.  I followed this great tutorial to set up my credentials - https://youtu.be/Bg9r_yLk7VY?t=577 .  Be sure to add credentials.py to a .gitignore file so you don't expose your credentials if you're uploading to GitHub.

# Gmail app password settings
EMAIL = "Sender@gmail.com"
PASS = "tXXXXXXXXXXXXXXg"
